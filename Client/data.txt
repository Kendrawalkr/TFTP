step 5


associate handler to SIGALRM interrupt in main in both server and client

make alarm(unsigned int t) func call after sending message with global const unsigned int t (interval in seconds)

1 handler in server and client for the SIGALRM
  re-associate the handler with SIGALRM in handler
  1 global volatile var in server and client to store recvfrom()'s return value to check in handler if received message or not
    increase consec timeout counter by 1 if actual timeout occured
      terminate connection if 10 consecutive timeouts
    resend msg if actual timeout
    restart timer if actual timeout

cancel alarm after recieving message by calling alarm(0)

1 global volatile var in server and client for consecutive timeouts
  reset to 0 wen a message is received

reset recvfrom()'s return variable to 0 after receiving msg
